	abstract = {Trace elements of quartz document the physical-chemical evolutions of quartz growth, which has been a great and most applied tool in the study of geological settings in quartz-forming environments. A classic method is using graphic diagram plots visualizing the quartz trace element discriminations and trends, examples including the Al-Ti diagram (Rusk, 2012, https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22161-3\_14) and the Ti-Al-Ge diagram (Schrön et al., 1988, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236149159\_Geochemische\_Untersuchungen\_an\_Pegmatitquarzen). However, those diagrams are limited to two dimensions and cannot show the information in a higher dimension. In the study, we thus used a machine learning-based approach to evaluate quartz trace elements, and visualized them for the first time in the high-dimensional diagrams. We revisited 1,626 quartz samples from nine geological environments from previous studies, and applied a support vector machine to characterize values of the contained trace elements, including Al, Ti, Li, Ge, and Sr. We demonstrate that support vector machines can identify the crystallization environment of quartz with a significantly higher accuracy than the traditional plotting methods. Our work can massively improve the confidence on distinguishing quartz origin from different geological environments with a high efficiency. The method may also be applicable for other minerals, and we anticipate our research is a starting point for investigating mineral trace elements with machine learning techniques.

	abstract = {Visualization techniques for understanding and explaining machine learning models have gained significant attention. One such technique is the decision map, which creates a 2D depiction of the decision behavior of classifiers trained on high-dimensional data. While several decision map techniques have been proposed recently, such as Decision Boundary Maps (DBMs), Supervised Decision Boundary Maps (SDBMs), and DeepView (DV), there is no framework for comprehensively evaluating and comparing these techniques. In this paper, we propose such a framework by combining quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment. We apply our framework to DBM, SDBM, and DV using a range of both synthetic and real-world classification techniques and datasets. Our results show that none of the evaluated decision-map techniques consistently outperforms the others in all measured aspects. Separately, our analysis exposes several previously unknown properties and limitations of decision-map techniques. To support practitioners, we also propose a workflow for selecting the most appropriate decision-map technique for given datasets, classifiers, and requirements of the application at hand.},

	abstract = {High-dimensional data are a key study object for both machine learning (ML) and information visualization. On the visualization side, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods, also called projections, are the most suited techniques for visual exploration of large and high-dimensional datasets. On the ML side, high-dimensional data are generated and processed by classifiers and regressors, and these techniques increasingly require visualization for explanation and exploration. In this paper, we explore how both fields can help each other in achieving their respective aims. In more detail, we present both examples that show how DR can be used to understand and engineer better ML models (seeing helps learning) and also applications of DL for improving the computation of direct and inverse projections (learning helps seeing). We also identify existing limitations of DR methods used to assist ML and of ML techniques applied to improve DR. Based on the above, we propose several high-impact directions for future work that exploit the analyzed ML-DR synergy.},

	abstract = {Machine learning improves geochemistry discriminant diagrams in classifying mineral deposit genetic types. However, the increasingly recognized ‘black box’ property of machine learning has been hampering the transparency of complex data analysis, leading to the challenge in deep geochemical interpretation. To address the issue, we revisited pyrite trace elements and propose to use ‘Decision Map’, a cutting-edge visualization technique for machine learning. This technique reveals mineral deposit classifications by visualizing the ‘decision boundaries’ of high-dimensional data, a concept crucial for model interpretation, active learning, and domain adaptation. In the context of geochemical data classification, it enables geologists to understand the relationship between geo-data and decision boundaries, assess prediction certainty, and observe the data distribution trends. This bridges the gap between the insightful properties of traditional discriminant diagrams and the high-dimensional efficiency of modern machine learning. Using pyrite trace element data, we construct a decision map for mineral deposit type classification, which maintains the accuracy of machine learning while adding valuable visualization insight. Additionally, we demonstrate two applications of decision maps. First, we show how decision maps can help resolve the genetic type dispute of a deposit whose data was not used in training the models. Second, we demonstrate how the decision maps can help understand the model, which further helps find indicator elements of pyrite. The recommended indicator elements by decision maps are consistent with geologists’ knowledge. This study confirms the decision map’s effectiveness in interpreting mineral genetic type classification problems. In geochemistry classification, it marks a shift from conventional machine learning to a visually insightful approach, thereby enhancing the geological understanding derived from the model. Furthermore, our work implies that decision maps could be applicable to diverse classification challenges in geosciences.},

	abstract = {Current inverse projection methods are often complex, hard to predict, and may require extensive parametrization. We present a new technique to compute inverse projections of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)-based projections with minimal parametrization. We use mutilateration, a method used for geopositioning, to find data values for unknown 2D points, i.e., locations where no data point is projected. Our technique can invert 2 dimensional projections up to {\textbar}D{\textbar} − 1 dimensional spaces given a minimum of {\textbar}D{\textbar} data points. As we use a straightforward geometrical relationship, our technique is more interpretable than comparable machine learning-based approaches. We qualitatively and quantitatively compare our technique with existing inverse projection techniques on synthetic and real-world datasets using mean-squared errors (MSEs) and gradient maps. When MDS captures data distances well, our approach performs similarly to existing approaches. While our method may show higher MSE when inverting known data points, it produces smoother gradient maps, indicating a higher predictability when inverting unseen points.},
